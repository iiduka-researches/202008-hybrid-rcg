# An implementation of the Hybrid Riemannian conjugate gradient method

This repository provides a solver of [pymanopt](https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt),
which is an implementation of the Hybrid Riemannian conjugate gradient method.

All numerical examples presented in the paper are used this implementation.
Our implementation is the modification of `pymanopt.solver.ConjugateGradient`.

## Experiments
The experiments follow the examples of [pymanopt](https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt/tree/master/examples).
